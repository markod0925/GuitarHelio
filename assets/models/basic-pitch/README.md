Vendored Basic Pitch model assets used by browser-side utilities (for example `src/audio/audioToMidiBrowser.ts`).

Source package: `@spotify/basic-pitch` (currently `1.0.1`)
Original package path: `node_modules/@spotify/basic-pitch/model/`

Included files:
- `model.json`
- `group1-shard1of1.bin`

This folder provides a deployment-stable model path so audio-to-MIDI conversion does not depend on package-internal paths in `node_modules`.
